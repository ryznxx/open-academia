# OpenAcademia

OpenAcademia is an open-source academic management system designed for institutions that require full control over their academic infrastructure without dependency on proprietary vendors.

This project exists to address long-standing issues in campus information systems: opaque licensing, rigid contracts, limited extensibility, and platforms that prioritize vendor convenience over institutional autonomy.

## Why OpenAcademia

Academic systems are critical infrastructure. They should not be treated as rented software governed by closed code, undocumented constraints, or long-term vendor lock-in.

OpenAcademia is built on the following principles:

- **Institutional Ownership**  
  Data, configuration, and infrastructure remain entirely under institutional control.

- **Transparency by Design**  
  All system behavior is auditable through publicly available source code.

- **No Vendor Lock-In**  
  Institutions are free to deploy, modify, and migrate without contractual dependency.

- **Modern Architecture**  
  Built using contemporary, maintainable technology rather than legacy stacks preserved for compatibility with outdated business models.

## Key Characteristics

- Open-source under a copyleft license to ensure modifications remain public
- Self-hosted and infrastructure-agnostic
- Container-first distribution
- Web-based configuration without direct code modification
- Designed for gradual adoption and pilot deployments
- Suitable for small IT teams and limited infrastructure environments

---

## Intended Use

OpenAcademia is suitable for:

- Universities and colleges seeking long-term autonomy over academic systems
- Institutions with limited infrastructure but complex academic workflows
- IT teams that prefer engineering clarity over vendor abstraction
- Campuses evaluating alternatives to closed, high-cost academic platforms

---

## Philosophy

OpenAcademia does not aim to replicate proprietary systems feature-by-feature.  
It aims to replace the dependency model behind them.

Academic institutions should own their systems, understand their behavior, and evolve them on their own terms.

---

## Installation

OpenAcademia is distributed using prebuilt containers and an installer that handles system checks, configuration, and deployment.

Installation and configuration are performed without modifying application source code.

Detailed installation instructions are provided in the documentation.

---

## Licensing

OpenAcademia is released under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3).

Any modification or deployment of this system over a network requires the modified source code to be made publicly available under the same license.

This ensures that improvements remain accessible to the academic community rather than being absorbed into closed commercial offerings.

## Disclaimer

OpenAcademia is provided as-is, without warranty.

Institutions adopting this system are expected to evaluate, deploy, and maintain it according to their own operational requirements.
