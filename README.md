# OpenAcademia

**OpenAcademia** is an open-source academic management system designed for higher education institutions that require full ownership and control over their academic infrastructure, without dependency on proprietary vendors.

The system is developed with alignment to **Indonesian academic management standards**, including common administrative structures, academic workflows, and governance practices used in Indonesian higher education institutions, while remaining flexible enough for broader adoption.

This project exists to address long-standing issues in campus information systems, such as opaque licensing models, rigid vendor contracts, limited extensibility, and platforms that prioritize vendor convenience over institutional autonomy.

A high-level system overview and workflow design can be accessed here:
