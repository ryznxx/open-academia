# OpenAcademia

OpenAcademia is an open-source academic management system designed for institutions that require full control over their academic infrastructure without dependency on proprietary vendors.

This project exists to address long-standing issues in campus information systems: opaque licensing, rigid contracts, limited extensibility, and platforms that prioritize vendor convenience over institutional autonomy.
